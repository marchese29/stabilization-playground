# Dan's Stabilization Playground
I'm using this repo to test various video stabilization algorithms and possibly to implement my own.

This is an implementation of video stabilization using [Phase Correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_correlation) and [Kalman Filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter).
